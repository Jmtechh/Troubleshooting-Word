<h1>Troubleshooting Word</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The aim of this lab is to practice using Active directory via virtual box. In this lab I create two Windows virtual machines. One of them will be the domain controller which I will install Active Directory and the other will be the client which will be under the domain of the domain controller vm. One of the goals of this lab is to enable network communication between the two virtual machines through IP addressing, routing and NAT. Another goal is to create multiple users and input it into Active Directory. This will be done by running a script in powershell that automatically inputs a list of users/names into the Acitve Directory system.
